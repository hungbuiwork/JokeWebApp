A web application I created for my User Interaction Informatics class in the Angular framework.
The application consists of an interface that allows the user to load and read many 2-part jokes generated from 

JokeAPI: https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/

exploring alternative forms of interaction, the application uses

HandTrack.js: https://victordibia.com/handtrack.js/#/

for basic controls


List of HandTrack.js controls:
1 open hand swiping right: View the next joke
1 open hand swiping left: View the previous joke
1 closed hand: Reveal the current joke's punchline
1 pointed hand: add/remove the joke from favorites

2 open hands: Generate 10 Jokes
2 pointed hands: Discard all current jokes
2 closed hands: Zoom text

There currently is not a published build, but I am currently working on this!
